# Kraft Punk Bot Privacy Policy
This bot uses Discord's [message content privileged intent](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404772028055-Message-Content-Privileged-Intent-FAQ) to read the contents of messages sent in your server to see if any of them contain trigger phrases for the bot to respond to. This means that **all messages in your server are sent to the bot.** This is necessary to have the bot react on its own without users explicitly triggering it.

**All messages are discarded after the bot checks them for trigger phrases.** I understand this is something that is easy to abuse and keep the code for the bot published here so that you can verify my claims about how I handle this data.

If you add this bot to your Discord server the following data will be collected and stored:
- The ID of your Discord server and the IDs of any channels you tell the bot to be muted in
